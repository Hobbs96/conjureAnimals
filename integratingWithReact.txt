First of all, I don't have any experience using Slack, but I think that doesn't really matter. There are several pieces you need to put together for this to work. First, you have your Python script, which you say it works ok - I'm guessing the script works by manually running it from the terminal, so you need a way of exposing it to the internet.

That's what you called cgi.

There are many ways of doing this, but it basically boils down to having a web server with an endpoint that, when accessed, launches your script with the appropriate parameters and returns its output. As you seem familiar with Python, I'd advise you to take a look at Flask, a really easy to use microframework that will allow you to set up a small web application. There are several ways of running your web application, particularly depending on what web server you're using. A quick Google search will show many tutorials about that matter.

Also, it's important that you properly format the messages sent from the backend to your web frontend and viceversa. That's why you've mentioned JSON. It's a great way of passing messages back and forth. You can easily convert Python objects (like dicts) to JSON using built-in and third party libraries.

In order to dynamically request and load information from the frontend without refreshing your website, you'll need some kind of asynchronous procedure. That's what AJAX is about. It's a mechanism of sending and receiving information asynchronously, so your website can keep going while the information is still to be received.

However, doing AJAX requests by hand in a cross-browser compatible way is a PITA, so you're better off using jQuery and it's AJAX-related functions.

So those would be the elements and step you should follow to make JavaScript talk to Python.
