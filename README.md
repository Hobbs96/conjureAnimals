# conjureCreaturesDnD5e
A utility for randomly generating the creatures created by Conjuration spell in D&D 5e.

Don't hesitate to contact clarklindsay96@gmail.com with any feedback, feature requests, or other questions. Additionally,
I welcome any pull requests with the requirement that you write the cleanest code you can. 

This is a small GUI application to simplify the use of creature conjuration spells. 
The application loads in a creature list in a JSON format, meaning that it is extensible, even with custom creatures.

Due to legal reasons, there cannot be a database to retrieve stat-blocks for the creatures that are generated. That being the case,
it is still necessary to have D&D material on hand, ex. a monster manual.
